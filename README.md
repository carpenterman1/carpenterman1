HI,  I carpenterman1.  I looking to relearn COBOL programming as I realize this language is still used today and programmers are in need.  Back in the day, I 
was a systems support tech (Ford Motor Company/Visteon).  I haven't programmed is over 20 years, but seems like this reintroduction would benefit my career and 
explore new adventures.  Thanks
